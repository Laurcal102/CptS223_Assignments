## MA0 BST Code Implementation
*By Lauri Calvert*

**Program Description**
The goal of this program was to implement some unfinished functionality to an esablished BST codebase.

**Makefile Usage**
I included a makefile in the project that is ready to be used with a launch json. Configure a standard gdb launch json and have the *Program* section configured with "${workspaceFolder}/mainexe". The make can then either be used with just *make* or *make mainexe* the program can then be ran with the executable *./mainexe*

*I have also included a screenshot of a successful build using this method in the project.*
